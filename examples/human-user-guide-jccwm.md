Kind of funny - my maiden name was 3 short letters!

### Work Ethic / Philosophy

* Anything worth doing is worth doing well; 
* We are stronger together and helping a colleague is never lost time.
* Being silly and playful within a team makes work more fun, and enables members to not only survive but thrive in times of stress
* If you're not learning, and sharing what you've learned, it's time to make a change.

### Quotes I live by
* "Fairy tales are more than true: not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten."  - Neil Gaiman in Coraline, which he attributes to G.K. Chesterton.
* "There is a special place in hell for women who do not help other women." - Secretary of State Madeline Albright.
* "No matter what message you are about to deliver somewhere, whether it is holding out a hand of friendship, or making clear that you disapprove of something, is the fact that the person sitting across the table is a human being, so the goal is to always establish common ground." - Secretary of State Madeline Albright.


### What are some honest, unfiltered things about you?
* Mnemonic devices are not always consciously chosen; non-sequitors usually aren't
* More than once I've said something or made a call on something I couldn't possibly know, only to have it come true or happen shortly thereafter.
* I whole-heartedly believe in servant-leadership: you cannot lead without serving


### What are your quirks?
* I may procrastinate when I have a [frog to eat](https://blog.noisli.com/what-it-means-to-eat-the-frog/) but my sense of obligation means my definition of "last minute" _isn't_ really last minute.
* I read _everything_ : Send me an article you found interesting, I'm your friend forever!
* Ikigai - At the junction of legal, policy, and security I found my ikigai or _purpose_ - and I've always liked Venn diagrams. 
* I have a penchant for puns - `tenderlove` is a personal hero, up there with Groucho Marx with his, _"Outside of a dog, a book is a man’s best friend. Inside of a dog, it’s too dark to read."_ 


### What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?
* I have a background in citation and fact-checking including having had the privilege of working on several Supreme Court briefs; when I correct grammar or suggest changes, there's no ego on my part - I just want your work to shine.


### What drives you nuts?
* People who make promises they don't keep. 
* People who make assumptions rather than asking direct questions.


## Feedback and Recognition 

### How do you coach people to do their best work and develop their talents?
* I believe strongly in [servant-leadership](https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/why-isnt-servant-leadership-more-prevalent): Serve to lead, lead by example. Influence and empathy are often more powerful than actual authority.
* Share what you're passionate about, what you'd really like to see in the community, and tap into my network for connections that will help you soar.

There's a book by Adam Grant, [Give and Take: A Revolutionary Approach to Success](http://www.amazon.com/Give-Take-Revolutionary-Approach-Success/dp/0670026557) (New York: Viking Press, 2013), that is incredible.

### What qualities do you particularly value in your colleagues?
* I love people who ask tough questions, and who don't shy away when there are ambiguous answers that require research. 
* I admire those who have positive regard for others and who believe everyone has something to teach us.
* Honesty. Ethics. Grace under fire. 

### What’s the best way to communicate with you?
* I like Zoom: hit me up for virtual coffee or to work through a security questionnaire realtime
* Slack for short convos
* Issues with task lists make me happy checking off work accomplished
	 
### How do you like to give feedback?
* I believe in saying thank you and showing appreciation - particularly for folks who go above and beyond the call of duty. I believe in sharing with others when folks have done amazing work. Reaching out and delivering appreciation to someone's manager when they do something amazing or helpful - don't wait for 360 reviews. 

### How can people earn an extra gold star with you?
* *I love folks who write notes.* Handwritten thank yous or just dropping a "Hey! How are you? X made me think of you"
* People who take the time to teach :heart: 

### How do you like to get feedback?
* I like written feedback, post-mortems (Heck, I am a security person!) Let's figure out how we can repeat and improve. Or pull me aside and let's chat, directly if there's something that needs to happen (faster or differently). 

### What’s the best way to convince you to do something?
* Remind me _BRAVE, not PERFECT!_ Coming from a world where drafts were darn near perfect _before_ they are shown to others, I sometimes need to be reminded to share early thoughts and small iterations.
